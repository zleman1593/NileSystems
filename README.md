This is demo app that we made to test JAVA RMI. We made a simple app that simulates a service that allows users to search for and buy books.



1. Run make file to compile all classes
2. Start the following three classes in this order: First CatalogServer, second OrderServer, third FrontEndServer, then run Simulator as many times as you want.

The simulator client is run last and will simulate multiple users using multiple clients to perform various actions. It can be modified in a straight forward way.
